# Description
I know there are already a lot of mod packs out there. The goal of this set up is to simply complete the game without straying too far from vanilla.

# Nexus Requirements
[Recipe Customization](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1245?tab=files) is required to be installed from Nexus Mods. If you don't install this, you won't see the new weapons!

# Features
 - The first 5 biomes are largely untouched. 1 or 2 enemies were added per biome, some friendly NPCs, and some new weapons
 - 5 New metals and 3 complete weapon sets for unfinished biomes
 - Elemental swords
 - Boss altars for Mistlands, Ashlands, and Deep North
 - 6 top tier armor sets
 - Storm Wolves and Drakes that spawn during rain storms
